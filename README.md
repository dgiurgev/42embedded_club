# Embedded Club

Welcome to the Embedded Club repository!  
Here we explore electronics, programming, sensors, and embedded systems. Our projects range from simple microcontroller experiments to fully custom hardware like keyboards and IoT devices.

## 🧩 In Progress

We’re always tinkering with new ideas — some work, some don’t, and that’s part of the fun.  
Projects change as we learn, experiment, and figure things out along the way.

A few things floating around right now:
- small sensor experiments  
- tiny wireless gadgets  
- custom controller ideas  

Nothing too serious — just a bunch of students learning by building and breaking stuff together.

## 🤝 Join the Club

We’re a bunch of 42 students who enjoy building things that *do* stuff — keyboards, sensors, small robots, IoT devices, or whatever idea pops up next.  

You don’t need any hardware experience to join — just curiosity and a willingness to learn.  
If you want to tinker, learn, or hang out with others who like making things, join our Telegram group:
